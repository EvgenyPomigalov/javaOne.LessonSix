Among the facilities provided by the <code>System</code> class
 * are standard input, standard output, and error output streams;
 * access to externally defined properties and environment
 * variables; a means of loading files and libraries; and a utility
 * method for quickly copying a portion of an array

 * The "standard" input stream. This stream is already
     * open and ready to supply input data. Typically this stream
     * corresponds to keyboard input or another input source specified by
     * the host environment or user.
